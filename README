Developed with web2py.

Document Management System LOL :) for home use with sane compatible
flatbed scanners...

There is no hierarchie among files just tags.

The application make use of crud.archive.

There is no document checkout or checkin.

There is only basic right management (just login and the user_1 can
add and delete users).

There is now only little set of scanner parameters to be set from a
fixed set of values :(

It is basically written based on the needs of mine.

The document scanned with scanimage converted to jpeg (Image modul) or
the jpeg's to pdf (convert program) if multiple pages are scanned.

Need to edit db.py

    db = DAL('...')

If you install the app. you need after register and login click to
"Check rights". It makes a dms group with access to database tables.
The users have to be a member of dms group to use the app. user_1
to...

Than click the "Config" to specify scanimage and convert program's
path.

Happy document management!

  fix it.
* There could be a facelift too :)
* I would like to apply any fix and enchancement pull request :)
